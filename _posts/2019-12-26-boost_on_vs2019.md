title: Boost on Visual Studio 2019
---

Build the Boost_1_72_0 libraries for MS Visual Studio 2019, the toolset seems be 14.2 although it seem not necessary modify the file project-config.jam.

Leaving that file "as is", and using the "developer command prompt to MS 2019" to build the libraries (in my case):

32 bits libraries:
```ps
> b2 release debug threading=multi --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc stage
```
64 bits libraries:
```ps
>  b2 release debug threading=multi --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc address-model=64 stage
```
The builder automatically generates libraries for msvc-14.2 in both versions, debug and release.
```ps
> b2 link=shared,static release debug threading=multi --build-type=complete --toolset=msvc address-model=64 stage
```

In order to allow CMake to find all of the appropriate files, I had to add the following three system variables:

    BOOST_INCLUDEDIR    C:\Libraries\boost_1_72_0\
    BOOST_LIBRARYDIR    C:\Libraries\boost_1_72_0\stage\lib
    BOOST_ROOT          C:\Libraries\boost_1_72_0\boost
